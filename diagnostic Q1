"""
Write a program which asks the user for their height in meters and prints whether or not they are the correct height to be a NASA astronaut.
If their height is between 1.6 meters and 1.9 meters, print "Correct height to be an astronaut". 
If their height is less than 1.6 meters, print "Below minimum astronaut height". If their height is greater than 1.9 meters,
print "Above maximum astronaut height".

Concepts:
The objective of this problem was to check your ability to do a two main things
Get input from a user, change its type to a float, and store it in a variable.
Use conditional statements (if, else and elif) as well as boolean operators.
You can read the Input Chapter, Booleans Chapter and If Chapter statements if you found this question hard!

There are many solutions to this problem. Here are a few
"""

# Example Solution 1
def main():
   # get the user height, cast it to a float, save as a variable
   user_height = float(input('Enter your height in meters: '))
   # first rule out that they are too short
   if user_height < 1.6:
      print('Below minimum astronaut height')
   # then rule out that they are too tall
   elif user_height > 1.9:
      print('Above maximum astronaut height')
   # at this point you know they are the correct height
   else:
      print('Correct height to be an astronaut')


# Example Solution 2
def main():
   user_height = float(input('Enter you height in meters: '))
   if user_height >= 1.6 and user_height <= 1.9:
      print('Correct height to be an astronaut')
   elif user_height < 1.6:
      print('Below minimum astronaut height')
   else:
      print('Above maximum astronaut height')
